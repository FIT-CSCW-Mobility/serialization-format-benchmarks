# Description

This project benchmarks common data serialization formats using [JMH](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/).

The sample data is taken from [here](https://github.com/maximn/SerializationPerformanceTest_CSharp/blob/master/SerializationPerformanceTest/TestData/BelgianBeer/Data/beers.xml).

# Formats

- EXI
- Fast Infoset
- Json (using Jackson)
- MessagePack
- Protocol Buffers
- Apache Thrift
- XML (using JAXB and Jackson)

### Thrift preparation

Thrift is a special case, because its code generator maven plugin expects the path of an installed Thrift library.
Make sure it is installed.


# Test cases

- Byte array (in memory) to Java Object
- Byte array (in memory, compressed with gzip) to Java Object
- Java Object to Byte array (in memory)
- Java Object to Byte array (in memory, compressed with gzip)


# System Requirements

* JDK 11
* Maven 

# How to use?

1. Build the project (a self-contained executable JAR, which holds the benchmarks):

    ```
    # mvn package
    ```

2. Run the benchmarks:

    ```
    # java -jar target/serialization-format-benchmarks.jar
    ```
